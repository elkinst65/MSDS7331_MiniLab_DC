Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis (you are not performing all of the CRISP-DM outline, only the portions relevant to the grading rubric outlined below). This report is worth 10% of the final grade. You may complete this assignment in teams of as many as three people.\n",

You can write the report in whatever format you like, but it is easiest to turn in the rendered iPython notebook. The results should be reproducible using your report.
